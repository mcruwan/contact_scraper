🔑 WHERE TO PUT YOUR OPENROUTER API KEY
========================================

OPTION 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)
---------------------------------------------
1. Open your terminal
2. Run this command (replace with your actual key):

   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='sk-or-v1-your-key-here'

3. To make it permanent, add this line to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile:

   echo "export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='sk-or-v1-your-key-here'" >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc


OPTION 2: Create a .env file
-----------------------------
1. In this directory (/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/contact_scraper/)
2. Create a file named: .env
3. Add this line:

   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here


GETTING YOUR API KEY

1. Visit: https://openrouter.ai
2. Sign up (free)

5. Copy the key (starts with sk-or-v1-...)


TESTING IT WORKS
----------------
After setting your key, test it:

You should see: "✓ AI extraction enabled using model: ..."


USAGE
-----
Once configured, AI extraction works automatically:

   # Command line
   python3 oxylabs_integration.py https://university.edu/ 20

   # Web interface
   python3 app.py
   # Then open: http://localhost:5000


COSTS (Very Cheap!)
-------------------
- 100 emails scraped: ~$0.004
- 1,000 emails scraped: ~$0.04
- 10,000 emails scraped: ~$0.40

Most of the time, names are found for free using heuristics.
AI is only used as a smart fallback (about 40% of the time).
